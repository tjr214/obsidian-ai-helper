## Instruction

What tasks are available for us to work on next?

It is unnecessary to reinitialize the project (`initialize_project`) to run this command. In fact, doing so will screw up the existing configuration.

Do not search for tasks, just use the taskmaster tool to get the next task.

CRITICAL: When calling the `next_task` tool, you must specify the FULL PATH for the tasks.json file using the `file` parameter. If you need to, use your search tool to find it in our project.

If there is no `tasks.json` file, then just let me know with an error message and then stop.
