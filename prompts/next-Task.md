## Instruction

What tasks are available for us to work on next?

It is unnecessary to reinitialize the project (`initialize_project`) to run this command. In fact, doing so will screw up the existing configuration.

Do not search for tasks, just use the taskmaster tool to get the next task.

If there is no `tasks.json` file, then just let me know with an error message and then stop.
