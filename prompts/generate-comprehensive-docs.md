# Generate Comprehensive Project Documentation

## Task Description

Create a comprehensive set of documentation files in the `docs/` directory by analyzing the entire codebase to understand the project structure, architecture, components, and development status. The documentation should provide a complete picture of the project for both users and developers.

## Requirements

1. **Examine the entire codebase** - Go through EVERY file in the project to build a complete understanding
2. **Create ALL 7 documentation files** in the `docs/` directory:

    - `README.md` - Documentation index and navigation
    - `project-overview.md` - High-level project description
    - `architecture.md` - Technical architecture and patterns
    - `development-guide.md` - Developer setup and contribution guide
    - `components.md` - Component documentation
    - `development-log.md` - Chronological development history
    - `future-plans.md` - Roadmap and upcoming features

3. **Maintain consistent style** across all documents
4. **Include actual code examples** from the codebase
5. **Reference project-specific files and patterns**
6. **Document the current state** accurately, noting what's implemented vs. planned

## Specific File Content Guidelines

### 1. README.md

Create an index file that:

-   Lists all documentation files with brief descriptions
-   Provides separate sections for users and developers
-   Includes guidance on maintaining documentation

### 2. project-overview.md

Document the project's:

-   Introduction and purpose
-   Core functionality
-   Key features
-   Technical approach
-   Current status
-   Project goals
-   Target users

### 3. architecture.md

Document the project's:

-   Directory structure with detailed explanation
-   Core components and their responsibilities
-   Design patterns used throughout the codebase
-   Integration points with external systems
-   Data flow diagrams (when applicable)
-   Security considerations
-   Future architecture considerations

### 4. development-guide.md

Create a guide covering:

-   Development environment setup
-   Build and test processes
-   Coding standards
-   Working with key technologies
-   Debugging techniques
-   Contributing guidelines
-   Release process

### 5. components.md

Document:

-   Component organization and hierarchy
-   Detailed documentation of each major component
-   Usage examples with actual code from the project
-   Component patterns and best practices
-   Hooks and utilities related to components
-   Future/planned components

### 6. development-log.md

Create a chronological record of:

-   Major development milestones achieved so far
-   Key technical decisions and their rationales
-   Challenges encountered and solutions implemented
-   Current development status
-   Next planned development steps

### 7. future-plans.md

Document:

-   Current development roadmap with task references
-   Planned features with detailed descriptions
-   Long-term vision for the project
-   Technical improvements planned
-   Community engagement plans
-   Potential challenges

## Process

1. Start by scanning and understanding ALL project files
2. Pay special attention to:

    - Main source files
    - Configuration files
    - Component definitions
    - Documentation comments
    - README files
    - The `scripts/prd.txt` file
    - Task lists or project management files

3. For each documentation file:

    - Gather relevant information from the codebase
    - Organize information in a logical structure
    - Include specific examples and references to actual code
    - Maintain a consistent style and terminology

4. Cross-reference between documentation files for consistency

## Additional Considerations

-   Documentation should be useful to both new developers and experienced team members
-   Focus on clarity and accuracy over verbosity
-   Include diagrams and visual aids when helpful (described textually if generation isn't possible)
-   Note areas where documentation is based on inference rather than explicit code comments
-   Documentation should serve as a foundation that can evolve with the project

## Output

Create all 7 documentation files in the `docs/` directory with comprehensive, accurate content that follows the project's coding style and terminology.
