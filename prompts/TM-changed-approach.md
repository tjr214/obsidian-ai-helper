## Instruction

We've changed our approach. See below for details. After you understand the new approach, please update all future tasks to reflect this change.

Do not search for tasks, just use any appropriate taskmaster tools to get the job done.

If there is no `tasks.json` file, then just let me know with an error message and then stop.
