## Instruction

Please use the task-master parse-prd command to generate tasks from our PRD. The PRD is located at `scripts/prd.txt`.

It is unnecessary to reinitialize the project (`initialize_project`) to run the parse-prd command. In fact, doing so will screw up the existing configuration.

If there is no `scripts/prd.txt` file, then just let me know with an error message and then stop.

Do not bother looking for tasks yet, just use the parse-prd tool to create the tasks after confirming the prd.txt from which to parse the tasks. You do NOT need to reinitialize the project to parse-prd.
