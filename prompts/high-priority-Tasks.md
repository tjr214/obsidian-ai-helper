## Instruction

Show me all of our available high priority Tasks.

It is unnecessary to reinitialize the project (`initialize_project`) to run this command. In fact, doing so will screw up the existing configuration.

Do not search for tasks, just use the taskmaster tool to get high priority tasks.

If there is no `tasks.json` file, then just let me know with an error message and then stop.
