## Current Status

We just successfully initialized taskmaster-ai into our project, together.

Now, to fully set up our task management system, we need to create tasks based on a Product Requirements Document (PRD). This will help organize and track our project's development.

The next step is to create a PRD file (Product Requirements Document) which will be used to generate our project tasks.

Once we have a PRD file, we can use it to automatically generate tasks for the project. This will create the tasks folder structure and initial task files.

## Next Steps

Now that our project is initialized, the next step is to create the tasks by parsing a PRD. This will create the tasks folder and the initial task files (tasks folder will be created when parse-prd is run). The parse-prd tool will require a prd.txt file as input (typically found in the project root directory, scripts/ directory). I can create a prd.txt file by asking you about our idea, and then using the `scripts/example_prd.txt` file as a template to generate a prd.txt file in scripts/. You may skip all of this if I already have a prd.txt file. You can THEN use the parse-prd tool to create the tasks. So: step 1 after initialization is to create a prd.txt file in `scripts/prd.txt` or confirm if I already have one. Step 2 is to use the parse-prd tool to create the tasks. Do not bother looking for tasks after initialization, just use the parse-prd tool to create the tasks after creating a prd.txt from which to parse the tasks. You do NOT need to reinitialize the project to parse-prd.

## Instruction

If you see an attached `prd.txt` file then read that file with your tool and use it.
If there is not a PRD attached, then let's create one, together.
