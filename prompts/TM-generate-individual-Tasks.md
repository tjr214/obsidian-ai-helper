## Instruction

Please generate individual task files from `tasks.json`.

It is unnecessary to reinitialize the project (`initialize_project`) to run the taskmaster tools / commands. In fact, doing so will screw up the existing configuration.

CRITICAL: When calling the tool, you must specify the FULL PATH for the tasks.json file using the `file` parameter. If you need to, use your search tool to find it in our project.

If there is are no `tasks/*.*` or a `tasks/tasks.json` file, then just let me know with an error message and then stop.
