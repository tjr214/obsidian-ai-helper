# Task ID: 11
# Title: Integrate shadcn UI with Obsidian Plugin
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Install, configure, and test shadcn UI components to work seamlessly within the Obsidian plugin environment, ensuring compatibility with Obsidian's theming system.
# Details:
1. Install shadcn UI dependencies:
   - Run `npm install @shadcn/ui` and any peer dependencies
   - Add required tailwind dependencies: `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`

2. Configure tailwind.config.js:
   - Set up proper content paths to include plugin files
   - Configure theme extension to support Obsidian's CSS variables
   - Add dark mode configuration that detects Obsidian's theme

3. Create a components directory structure:
   - Set up the recommended shadcn UI folder structure
   - Create a UI registry file to manage component imports

4. Configure CSS integration:
   - Create a global.css file that imports tailwind directives
   - Set up CSS variable mapping between shadcn and Obsidian variables
   - Ensure CSS is properly bundled in the build process

5. Update build configuration:
   - Modify esbuild/webpack configuration to handle CSS processing
   - Configure PostCSS if needed
   - Ensure proper asset handling for any shadcn UI assets

6. Create theme adaptation layer:
   - Implement a theme provider component that reads Obsidian's current theme
   - Set up dynamic theme switching to respond to Obsidian theme changes
   - Map Obsidian's CSS variables to shadcn UI theme variables

7. Implement basic component examples:
   - Create a test view with common shadcn UI components
   - Ensure proper styling and behavior of components

# Test Strategy:
1. Visual Testing:
   - Create a test view with all major shadcn UI components (buttons, inputs, modals, etc.)
   - Verify components render correctly in both light and dark Obsidian themes
   - Check for any CSS conflicts or rendering issues
   - Test responsive behavior within different Obsidian window sizes

2. Theme Switching Tests:
   - Toggle between Obsidian light and dark themes to verify components adapt correctly
   - Verify no flickering or style inconsistencies during theme transitions
   - Test with custom Obsidian themes to ensure compatibility

3. Performance Testing:
   - Measure plugin load time before and after shadcn UI integration
   - Check for any performance degradation when rendering multiple components
   - Verify memory usage remains reasonable

4. Integration Testing:
   - Test component interactions within actual plugin features
   - Verify form submissions and data handling work correctly
   - Test modal dialogs and overlays function properly within Obsidian's DOM

5. Accessibility Testing:
   - Verify keyboard navigation works for all components
   - Test with screen readers to ensure proper ARIA attributes
   - Check color contrast meets accessibility standards in both themes

   - Check that the project structure is properly set up

## 2. Configure tailwind for Obsidian compatibility [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Modify tailwind configuration to work with Obsidian's theming system and ensure proper CSS processing
### Details:
1. Update tailwind.config.js:
   - Configure content paths: `content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"]`
   - Set up dark mode detection: `darkMode: "class"`
   - Configure theme extension to map to Obsidian variables
2. Create global.css in the styles directory:
   - Add tailwind directives: `@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;`
   - Set up CSS variable mapping between shadcn and Obsidian
3. Update build configuration:
   - Modify esbuild/webpack to process CSS files
   - Configure PostCSS with autoprefixer
   - Ensure CSS is properly bundled in the output
4. Testing approach:
   - Verify tailwind configuration loads without errors
   - Confirm CSS processing works in the build pipeline
   - Check that basic tailwind classes work in a test component

## 3. Create theme adaptation layer for Obsidian [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Implement a system to detect and adapt to Obsidian's theme changes, ensuring shadcn UI components match the current theme
### Details:
1. Create a ThemeProvider component:
   - Implement detection of Obsidian's current theme (light/dark)
   - Set up listeners for Obsidian theme change events
   - Create a context to provide theme information to components
2. Map Obsidian CSS variables to shadcn UI theme variables:
   - Create a mapping file that connects Obsidian's CSS variables to shadcn's theme system
   - Implement dynamic CSS variable application based on current theme
3. Add theme switching functionality:
   - Create utility functions to update theme variables when Obsidian's theme changes
   - Ensure smooth transitions between themes
4. Testing approach:
   - Test theme detection in both light and dark Obsidian themes
