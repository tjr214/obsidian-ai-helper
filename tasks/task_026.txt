# Task ID: 26
# Title: Develop UI Rendering for Streaming Updates
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a UI rendering approach that updates the Obsidian interface as new chunks arrive from the stream.
# Details:
Create a StreamingUIRenderer that: 1) Takes accumulated response data from the StreamResponseAccumulator, 2) Renders incremental updates to the Obsidian UI, 3) Handles different content types (text, code blocks, etc.), 4) Shows visual indicators during tool execution, 5) Updates smoothly without flickering or jumping, 6) Maintains cursor position appropriately. Implement debouncing to prevent too-frequent UI updates. Add visual indicators for stream status (active, paused for tool execution, completed, error).

# Test Strategy:
Test UI rendering with various streaming response patterns. Verify smooth updates without flickering. Test with different content types and ensure proper formatting. Verify visual indicators correctly show stream status. Test with very fast and very slow streams to ensure good performance.
