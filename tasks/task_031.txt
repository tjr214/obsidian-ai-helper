# Task ID: 31
# Title: Integrate and Test Complete Streaming Workflow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate all components into a complete workflow and validate against acceptance criteria.
# Details:
Perform final integration of all components: 1) Connect SSEParser, StreamResponseAccumulator, StreamController, and UI components, 2) Implement the complete conversation flow with streaming responses and tool calls, 3) Add configuration options for streaming behavior, 4) Create comprehensive documentation for the implementation, 5) Perform end-to-end testing against the acceptance criteria. Ensure all edge cases are handled properly. Verify that the implementation meets all requirements specified in the PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct end-to-end testing with real OpenRouter API calls. Verify all acceptance criteria are met: streaming responses appear in real-time, tool calls work in streaming mode, SSE responses are correctly parsed, error states are handled gracefully, and streaming can be toggled on/off. Test with various conversation scenarios including complex tool usage patterns.
