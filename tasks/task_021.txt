# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Error Handling and Logging
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance error handling throughout the implementation to provide a robust user experience.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive error handling for all aspects of the OpenRouter tools functionality, including API errors, tool execution failures, and UI issues. Create user-friendly error messages and recovery mechanisms. Implement a logging system for tracking errors and debugging issues. Include automatic retry mechanisms for transient errors and graceful degradation when services are unavailable.

# Test Strategy:
Test error handling by simulating various error conditions, including network failures, API errors, and tool execution failures. Verify that error messages are clear and helpful. Test recovery mechanisms to ensure they work as expected. Verify that logging provides sufficient information for debugging without exposing sensitive data.
