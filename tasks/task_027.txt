# Task ID: 27
# Title: Implement Error Handling for Streaming Responses
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance error handling to provide graceful degradation and clear error messages for streaming-related issues.
# Details:
Create a comprehensive error handling system that: 1) Catches and categorizes different types of streaming errors (network, parsing, timeout), 2) Provides user-friendly error messages for common issues, 3) Implements automatic retry for transient errors, 4) Gracefully falls back to non-streaming mode when appropriate, 5) Logs detailed error information for troubleshooting. Add specific handlers for SSE parsing failures, network interruptions, and malformed responses. Implement a circuit breaker pattern to prevent repeated failures.

# Test Strategy:
Test with various error scenarios including network failures, malformed SSE data, and timeout conditions. Verify appropriate error messages are displayed. Test automatic retry functionality and fallback to non-streaming mode. Verify logging captures sufficient detail for troubleshooting.
