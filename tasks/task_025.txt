# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Stream Pause and Resume for Tool Execution
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a mechanism to pause stream processing when tools need to be called and resume after tool execution completes.
# Details:
Develop a StreamController class that: 1) Can pause the processing of the incoming stream when a tool call is detected, 2) Maintains the stream connection while paused, 3) Executes the tool call using the existing tool execution framework, 4) Incorporates tool results into the conversation history, 5) Resumes stream processing after tool execution, 6) Handles multiple sequential tool calls. Implement proper state management to track whether the stream is active, paused, or completed.

# Test Strategy:
Test the pause/resume functionality with mock streams and tool calls. Verify that tool execution completes correctly during a pause. Test multiple sequential tool calls and ensure the stream properly resumes after each. Verify conversation history is correctly updated with tool results.
