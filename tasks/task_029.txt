# Task ID: 29
# Title: Implement Fallback Mechanism for Non-Streaming Mode
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a fallback system that can switch to non-streaming mode when streaming fails or is not supported.
# Details:
Develop a dual-mode system that: 1) Attempts streaming mode first, 2) Detects streaming failures or compatibility issues, 3) Automatically falls back to non-streaming mode when needed, 4) Maintains consistent behavior between modes, 5) Allows users to manually select preferred mode. Implement feature detection to determine if streaming is supported. Create a seamless transition between modes that preserves conversation context and tool functionality.

# Test Strategy:
Test automatic fallback when streaming fails. Verify manual mode selection works correctly. Compare results between streaming and non-streaming modes to ensure consistent behavior. Test edge cases where streaming initially works but then fails mid-response.
