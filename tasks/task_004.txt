# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement chat interface with message history and persistence
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the core chat interface components and implement message persistence.
# Details:
Create the chat interface with message history display, input area, and control buttons. Implement the Message data model with ID, timestamp, role, content, and metadata. Design the Chat Session data model to track session information. Implement local storage for chat history persistence. Add message formatting for markdown support. Create loading states and progress indicators. Implement basic error handling for the chat interface. Add support for different message types (text, system messages, tool results).

# Test Strategy:
Test sending and receiving messages. Verify messages are correctly formatted and displayed. Test persistence by closing and reopening the plugin. Verify loading states appear appropriately during API calls.
