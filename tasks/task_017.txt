# Title: Implement Vault File Access Tool
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a tool that allows the AI to access and read files within the user's Obsidian vault.
# Details:
Implement a file access tool that can retrieve the content of files within the user's Obsidian vault. Use Obsidian's API to safely access vault files. Include parameters for specifying files by path or by search criteria. Implement proper error handling for missing files, permission issues, and other potential problems. Consider adding functionality to search across multiple files or to extract specific sections of files.

# Test Strategy:
Test the file access tool with various file paths, including existing files, missing files, and files with different content types. Verify that file content is correctly retrieved and formatted. Test with large files to ensure performance is acceptable.
