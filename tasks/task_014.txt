# Task ID: 14
# Title: Create Core Tool Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a flexible and extensible framework for defining, registering, and executing tools.
# Details:
Design and implement a tool registry system that allows for easy registration of new tools. Create interfaces for tool definitions, including parameters, return types, and validation rules. Implement a tool execution engine that can invoke the appropriate tool based on the AI's request, validate inputs and outputs, and handle errors gracefully. Include support for asynchronous tool execution and timeout handling.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for the tool registry, tool definition validation, and tool execution engine. Test registration of multiple tools, validation of tool parameters, and proper execution of tool functions. Verify error handling for invalid tool calls and failed tool executions.
