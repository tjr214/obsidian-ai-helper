# Obsidian AI Helper: React Sidebar View Implementation

## Overview

This task involves creating a React-based view that appears in Obsidian's right sidebar. The view will contain React components that can access the Obsidian App object and interact with the user's vault.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Project Structure Setup

-   [ ] Create necessary directories (if they don't exist):
    -   [ ] `src/views/` - For the ItemView implementation
    -   [ ] `src/components/` - For React components
    -   [ ] `src/context/` - For React context providers
    -   [ ] `src/hooks/` - For custom React hooks

### Phase 2: Core Implementation

-   [ ] Create App Context

    -   [ ] Implement `AppContext.ts` to provide the Obsidian App object to React components
    -   [ ] Create `useApp.ts` hook for easy access to the App object

-   [ ] Create the View Component

    -   [ ] Implement `AIHelperView.ts` extending ItemView
    -   [ ] Set up React mounting and unmounting in the view

-   [ ] Create React Components
    -   [ ] Implement the main `AIHelperComponent.tsx`
    -   [ ] Add UI elements and functionality

### Phase 3: Integration with Plugin

-   [ ] Update `main.ts` to:
    -   [ ] Register the view
    -   [ ] Add a ribbon icon to activate the view
    -   [ ] Implement the `activateView()` method
    -   [ ] Update `onunload()` to clean up views

### Phase 4: Styling and Refinement

-   [ ] Add CSS styles to match Obsidian's look and feel
-   [ ] Test the view functionality
-   [ ] Refine UI/UX as needed
