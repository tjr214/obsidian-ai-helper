# Obsidian AI Helper: React Sidebar View Implementation

## Overview

This task involves creating a React-based view that appears in Obsidian's right sidebar. The view will contain React components that can access the Obsidian App object and interact with the user's vault.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Project Structure Setup

-   [x] Create necessary directories (if they don't exist):
    -   [x] `src/views/` - For the ItemView implementation
    -   [x] `src/components/` - For React components
    -   [x] `src/context/` - For React context providers
    -   [x] `src/hooks/` - For custom React hooks

### Phase 2: Core Implementation

-   [x] Create App Context

    -   [x] Implement `AppContext.ts` to provide the Obsidian App object to React components
    -   [x] Create `useApp.ts` hook for easy access to the App object

-   [x] Create the View Component

    -   [x] Implement `AIHelperView.tsx` extending ItemView
    -   [x] Set up React mounting and unmounting in the view

-   [x] Create React Components
    -   [x] Implement the main `AIHelperComponent.tsx`
    -   [x] Add UI elements and functionality

### Phase 3: Integration with Plugin

-   [x] Update `main.ts` to:
    -   [x] Register the view
    -   [x] Add a ribbon icon to activate the view
    -   [x] Implement the `activateView()` method
    -   [x] Update `onunload()` to clean up views

### Phase 4: Styling and Refinement

-   [x] Add CSS styles to match Obsidian's look and feel
-   [ ] Test the view functionality
-   [ ] Refine UI/UX as needed

## Progress Notes

### April 8, 2023

-   Created the project structure with necessary directories
-   Implemented the App Context and useApp hook for React components to access Obsidian's App object
-   Created the AIHelperView class to manage the React component's lifecycle
-   Implemented the AIHelperComponent that displays vault information
-   Updated main.ts to register and activate the view
-   Added CSS styles to match Obsidian's look and feel

### Build Issues

-   We've encountered TypeScript configuration issues with .tsx files. Need to ensure the build process works correctly.
-   Modified tsconfig.json to include .tsx files, but there might be issues with the compilation.

### Next Steps

-   Test the view in Obsidian to ensure it appears and functions correctly
-   Resolve any remaining build issues
-   Add more functionality to the React component as needed
