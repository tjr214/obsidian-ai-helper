# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Streaming Response Handler
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the existing code to properly handle streaming responses from OpenRouter API, allowing for real-time display of AI responses.
# Details:
Create a streaming response handler that processes chunks of text as they arrive from the OpenRouter API. Modify the fetch requests to use the ReadableStream API and implement proper event listeners for data chunks. Ensure the handler can parse JSON objects from the stream and extract text content, tool calls, and other relevant information. Include mechanisms to update the UI as new content arrives and handle stream completion events.

# Test Strategy:
Test with mock streams to verify correct parsing of different response types. Validate that partial responses display correctly and that the complete response is assembled properly. Test edge cases like empty streams, interrupted connections, and malformed responses.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Modify fetch requests to support streaming responses [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update the existing fetch implementation to support streaming responses from OpenRouter API by configuring the appropriate headers and response handling options.
### Details:
1. Modify the fetch request configuration to include 'stream: true' in the request options.
2. Set the appropriate headers for streaming: 'Accept: text/event-stream'.
3. Update the fetch call to handle the response as a ReadableStream instead of JSON.
4. Create a basic wrapper function that takes a prompt and returns a ReadableStream.
5. Test the implementation by making a simple request and confirming that a ReadableStream is returned rather than a complete response.
6. Handle basic error cases such as network failures or invalid API responses.
7. Test with mock data to ensure the streaming connection is properly established.

## 2. Implement stream processing and chunk parsing logic [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Create a handler that can process the incoming stream, parse the chunks of data, and extract the relevant information from each chunk.
### Details:
1. Create a StreamProcessor class/function that takes a ReadableStream as input.
2. Implement the logic to read chunks from the stream using a TextDecoder to convert Uint8Array to text.
3. Parse each chunk to identify the data format (typically 'data: {...}' lines in SSE format).
4. Extract the JSON payload from each chunk and handle potential parsing errors.
5. Implement logic to identify different types of content in the chunks (text content, tool calls, function calls, etc.).
6. Create a normalized data structure for each processed chunk that will be easy to consume by the UI.
7. Implement proper handling of special messages like '[DONE]' that indicate stream completion.
8. Add logging for debugging purposes.
9. Test with real API responses to ensure correct parsing of different message formats.

## 3. Implement UI update mechanism for streaming content [done]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Create a system to update the UI in real-time as new content arrives from the stream, handling both text updates and any special content types.
### Details:
1. Create an event-based system or callback mechanism that notifies the UI when new content is available.
2. Implement a content accumulator that builds the complete response as chunks arrive.
3. Add logic to handle different content types (text, code blocks, tool calls) and update the UI appropriately for each.
4. Implement debouncing or throttling to prevent too-frequent UI updates that might cause performance issues.
5. Add visual indicators for streaming status (starting, in progress, completed).
6. Handle edge cases such as stream interruptions or errors during streaming.
7. Implement a completion callback that fires when the stream is fully processed.
8. Add the ability to cancel an ongoing stream if the user requests it.
9. Test the complete flow from API request through streaming to UI updates with various response types.
10. Ensure the UI remains responsive during streaming of long responses.
