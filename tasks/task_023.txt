# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement Streaming Response Accumulator
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a state management system to accumulate and reconstruct partial responses from the stream into complete messages.
# Details:
Develop a `StreamResponseAccumulator` class that: 1) Maintains the current state of a partial response, 2) Processes incoming chunks from the SSEParser, 3) Reconstructs complete messages from partial chunks, 4) Handles different message types (text, tool calls, etc.), 5) Provides methods to access the current accumulated state, 6) Implements proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures. The accumulator should handle the complexities of OpenRouter's response format, including nested content structures.

# Test Strategy:
Test with various streaming response patterns to verify correct accumulation of partial responses. Verify that complete messages are properly reconstructed from chunks. Test edge cases like empty chunks, out-of-order chunks, and interrupted streams.
