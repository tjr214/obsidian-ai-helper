# Task ID: 30
# Title: Optimize Performance and Resource Usage
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Enhance the implementation to minimize memory usage, optimize token consumption, and handle rate limiting.
# Details:
Implement optimizations including: 1) Efficient stream processing to minimize memory usage, 2) Token usage tracking and optimization, 3) Rate limiting awareness and backoff strategies, 4) Cleanup of large objects when no longer needed, 5) Performance monitoring for streaming operations. Add configurable parameters for chunk processing and UI update frequency. Implement memory-efficient data structures for accumulating responses. Add token counting to prevent exceeding API limits.

# Test Strategy:
Profile memory usage during streaming operations. Test with very large responses to verify efficient handling. Measure and compare performance before and after optimizations. Test rate limiting scenarios to verify backoff strategies work correctly.
