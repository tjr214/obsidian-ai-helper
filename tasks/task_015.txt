# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Web Search Tool
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a web search tool that allows the AI to retrieve information from the internet.
# Details:
Implement a web search tool that interfaces with a search API (such as Bing, Google, or a free alternative). Define the tool's parameters (query, result count, etc.) and return format. Handle rate limiting, error states, and result formatting. Ensure the search results are properly sanitized and formatted for inclusion in the AI's response. Consider implementing caching to improve performance and reduce API calls.

# Test Strategy:
Test the web search tool with various queries, including edge cases like empty queries, very long queries, and queries with special characters. Verify that results are properly formatted and that error states (API unavailable, rate limited, etc.) are handled gracefully.
