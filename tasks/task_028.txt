# Task ID: 28
# Title: Add Stream Cancellation and Resource Cleanup
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement proper cancellation and cleanup of active streams to prevent resource leaks and allow user interruption.
# Details:
Enhance the StreamController to: 1) Support user-initiated cancellation of active streams, 2) Properly abort fetch requests using AbortController, 3) Clean up all resources when a stream ends or is cancelled, 4) Handle cancellation during tool execution, 5) Update UI appropriately when cancellation occurs. Implement proper event listeners for user cancellation actions. Ensure all promises are properly handled during cancellation to prevent unhandled rejections.

# Test Strategy:
Test cancellation at various points in the streaming process (during initial response, during tool execution, etc.). Verify all resources are properly cleaned up after cancellation. Test for memory leaks using browser dev tools. Verify UI correctly updates after cancellation.
