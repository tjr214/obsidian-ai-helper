# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement MCP client and vault interaction tools
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the Model Context Protocol client and implement tools for interacting with the Obsidian vault.
# Details:
Implement Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool discovery and usage. Create the Tool Definition data model with name, description, parameters, and handler function. Implement vault interaction tools: search notes, read note content, create new notes, and edit existing notes. Add proper error handling for tool execution. Implement tool result formatting for display in the chat. Create a system for managing tool permissions and user confirmation for sensitive operations.

# Test Strategy:
Test each vault interaction tool individually. Verify the MCP client correctly formats tool definitions and handles tool calls. Test error scenarios such as trying to access non-existent notes. Verify tool results are correctly displayed in the chat interface.
