# Task ID: 13
# Title: Develop Tool Call Processing for Streaming Responses
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance the streaming handler to properly detect and process tool calls within streaming responses.
# Details:
Extend the streaming handler to detect when the AI is making a tool call within a streaming response. Implement logic to pause the display of the response, execute the tool call, and then resume the streaming with the tool results incorporated. Create a queue system for handling multiple tool calls within a single response. Ensure that tool calls are properly formatted and validated before execution.

# Test Strategy:
Create test scenarios with simulated tool calls in streaming responses. Verify that tool calls are correctly identified, executed, and their results incorporated into the ongoing response. Test with multiple sequential tool calls and concurrent tool calls.
