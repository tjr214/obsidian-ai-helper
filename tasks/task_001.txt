# Task ID: 1
# Title: Set up plugin infrastructure with React integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the plugin structure, integrate React, and set up the basic architecture for the Obsidian AI Helper.
# Details:
Create the main plugin class that extends Obsidian's Plugin. Set up TypeScript configuration with strict mode. Integrate React using esbuild for bundling. Create the AppContext to share the Obsidian App object across components. Implement the useApp hook for accessing the App object. Set up the event handling system for communication between components. Create the basic folder structure following component reusability patterns.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the plugin loads in Obsidian without errors. Test that React components can render and access the Obsidian API through the context. Ensure the event system correctly propagates events between components.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize plugin structure and TypeScript configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the basic Obsidian plugin structure with proper TypeScript configuration in strict mode
### Details:
1. Create the main plugin class that extends Obsidian's Plugin
2. Set up the main.ts file with onload() and onunload() methods
3. Configure tsconfig.json with strict mode enabled
4. Create manifest.json with plugin metadata
5. Set up .gitignore and other project files
6. Test by ensuring the plugin loads in Obsidian developer mode without errors

## 2. Configure esbuild for React bundling [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up the build system using esbuild to bundle React components with the plugin
### Details:
1. Install necessary dependencies: React, React DOM, esbuild
2. Create esbuild configuration file
3. Set up build scripts in package.json
4. Configure JSX transformation in the build process
5. Add development and production build modes
6. Test by building the project and verifying the output bundle

## 3. Create folder structure and component architecture [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Establish a well-organized folder structure following component reusability patterns
### Details:
1. Create src/ directory with subdirectories: components/, hooks/, utils/, contexts/
2. Set up index files for clean imports
3. Create placeholder files for key components
4. Establish naming conventions and file organization standards
5. Document the architecture in README.md
6. Test by importing from these directories in a simple component

## 4. Implement AppContext for sharing Obsidian App object [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Create a React context to provide the Obsidian App object throughout the component tree
### Details:
1. Create AppContext.tsx in the contexts/ directory
2. Implement the AppProvider component that accepts the App object
3. Set up proper TypeScript typing for the context
4. Create a basic error boundary for the context
5. Add context initialization in the main plugin class
6. Test by rendering a component that consumes the context and verifies the App object is available

## 5. Develop useApp custom hook [done]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Create a custom React hook for easily accessing the Obsidian App object from any component
### Details:
1. Create useApp.ts in the hooks/ directory
2. Implement the hook to consume AppContext
3. Add proper error handling for when used outside context
4. Add TypeScript typing for return values
5. Document usage examples
6. Test by creating a simple component that uses the hook to access App functionality

## 6. Set up event handling system for component communication [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3, 1.4, 1.5
### Description: Implement an event system to facilitate communication between different React components
### Details:
1. Create an EventBus class in utils/ directory
2. Implement subscribe, unsubscribe, and emit methods
3. Create a useEventBus hook for React components
4. Add TypeScript interfaces for event types
5. Integrate the event system with the AppContext
6. Test by creating two components that communicate through events
