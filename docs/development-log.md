# Obsidian AI Helper: Development Log

This document tracks the development progress of the Obsidian AI Helper plugin, including key decisions, challenges, and milestones. The log is organized in reverse chronological order (newest entries first).

## Development Timeline

### April 2025

#### Project Initialization

-   Set up initial plugin infrastructure with TypeScript and React integration
-   Established basic architecture and organization patterns
-   Created React component mounting system in Obsidian
-   Implemented EventBus for component communication

#### React Integration

-   Created AppContext for providing Obsidian's App object to React components
-   Implemented useApp hook for easy access to the App object
-   Set up proper React mounting/unmounting in Obsidian's UI
-   Added basic event system for component communication

#### UI Foundations

-   Added AIHelperView for sidebar integration
-   Created AIHelperComponent with basic vault information display
-   Implemented event demo for demonstrating component communication
-   Started integration of shadcn UI components

## Key Decisions & Rationales

### React Integration Architecture

**Decision:** Use React with Context for component architecture

**Rationale:**

-   React provides a robust component model and efficient rendering
-   Context allows sharing the Obsidian App object throughout the component tree
-   Hooks provide a clean way to access Obsidian functionality
-   This approach allows for more maintainable and testable code

### Event-Based Communication

**Decision:** Implement a custom EventBus for component communication

**Rationale:**

-   Enables loosely coupled communication between components
-   Simplifies state management across different parts of the application
-   Allows for more flexible UI arrangements
-   Provides a clean pattern for handling asynchronous operations

### Shadcn UI Components

**Decision:** Use shadcn UI for component design

**Rationale:**

-   Provides a modern, clean design system
-   Components can be customized to match Obsidian's theming
-   Offers accessibility benefits out of the box
-   Allows for consistent styling across the application

### TypeScript Strict Mode

**Decision:** Enable TypeScript strict mode for the entire project

**Rationale:**

-   Catches potential errors at compile time
-   Improves code quality and maintainability
-   Provides better IDE support and autocomplete
-   Forces proper typing of all variables and functions

## Challenges & Solutions

### React Integration in Obsidian

**Challenge:** Integrating React with Obsidian's view system and ensuring proper lifecycle management

**Solution:**

-   Created a pattern for mounting React components in Obsidian views
-   Implemented proper cleanup in the onClose method of Obsidian views
-   Used Contexts to provide Obsidian's App object to React components
-   Created custom hooks for accessing Obsidian functionality

### Theme Compatibility

**Challenge:** Ensuring UI components work well with Obsidian's various themes

**Solution:**

-   Used Obsidian's CSS variables for styling
-   Implemented shadcn UI components with theme-aware design
-   Created a system that respects the user's theme preferences
-   Tested with both light and dark modes

## Current Status

-   Basic plugin infrastructure is set up and working
-   React integration is functional with proper mounting/unmounting
-   Event system is implemented and demonstrated
-   Initial UI components are in place

## Next Steps

1. Implement right panel view with tab system and floating windows (Task 2)
2. Create settings page and API integration layer (Task 3)
3. Develop chat interface with message history and persistence (Task 4)
4. Implement MCP client and vault interaction tools (Task 5)
