# Greetings

Hello, Claude! Let's develop, work, build and play together, as a Team!

# Global Always-Active Instructions

Our project is an Obsidian Plugin called `Obsidian AI Helper`. It is an agentic tool-using plugin that works with the user's Vault and its files.

- As we work, read and maintain the `README.md` file.
- Also, always follow the additional instructions given in the "Planning" Section, below.
- Use your search and read tools to see our codebase and view any files you need to.

- Before beginning any coding work, and at the start of any conversation, make sure we are on the same page. Ask me any questions you need to.
- Never just assume things. Asking clarifiying questions is _always_ preferable to just blindly and confidently forging ahead.

IMPORTANT! Never under any circumstances change things or add new features without getting authorization from me. Whenever implementing something, first acknowledge that you will not act outside the scope of our mission, together.

## Technology Stack and Details

We are working with Typescript and React (in Strict mode).

- Always use types.
- Always fully comment and explain our code.
- See the section "Using React in Obsidian Plugins", below, for additional instructions related to React.
- If we are building a component that needs access to the Obsidian `App` object, please see the section "Additional React Instructions Specific to Components Needing App Access" for detailed instructions.

## Working with Libraries and Packages

- Always use the latest version of libraries and packages (do not pin versions) of the library.
- When working with libraries and packages, always use the `context7` MCP tool to get the latest docs and example code snippets.

### CRITICAL: Library Documentation Protocol

- ANY mention of a library, package, framework, or module name (e.g., "React", "Better-Auth", "Express") MUST IMMEDIATELY trigger the use of context7 MCP tools.
- ALWAYS use resolve_library_id followed by get_library_docs before providing ANY information about a library.
- NEVER rely on general knowledge about libraries without first checking current documentation.
- When working with Obsidian ALWAYS refer to the latest Obsidain docs, found at: https://docs.obsidian.md/

Watch for these trigger patterns that ALWAYS require context7:
* Any question containing a library name followed by words like "how to", "usage", "implement", etc.
* Any question containing a library name preceeded by words like "use", etc.
* Any request for examples, tutorials, or guidance with a specific library
* Any troubleshooting question related to a library

## Planning

- Take your time and always think things through.
- Form a plan in your head before acting. Share that plan with me.
- Use the `taskmaster` rules and tools to help you in thinking and planning, or with any other task and plan related activity.

Use the `taskmaster` rules and MCP tools to read our PRD file, update the PRD file, show all tasks, create new tasks, update existing tasks, deal with sub-tasks, and all the other things we can do with taskmaster-ai.

### CRITICAL: Taskmaster Special Instructions

IMPORTANT: Do not ever use the `initialize_project` taskmaster MCP tool! Our project comes with taskmaster pre-initialized and re-running the initialization process will mess things up!

- ANY usage of the Taskmaster MCP tool must include the FULL PATH for the tasks.json file using the `file` parameter. If you need to, use your search tool to find it in our project
- ALWAYS include this FULL PATH when working with Taskmaster tools
- NEVER call a task master tool without providing the FULL PATH to the tasks.json file
- ALWAYS give the USER feedback about the tool's result. Do not just run the tool

These rules MUST BE FOLLOWED whether the tool request was initiated by the USER or by you, Claude, will doing agentic tasks.

# CRITICAL: Using React in Obsidian Plugins

## Create a React Component

This is an example of creating a React Component. It needs to be stored in the project root.

```tsx
export const ReactView = () => {
	return <h4>Hello, React!</h4>;
};
```

## Mount / Unmount the React Component

To use the React component, it needs to be mounted on HTML elements. The following example mounts the ReactView component on the this.containerEl.children[1] element:

```tsx
import { StrictMode } from "react";
import { ItemView, WorkspaceLeaf } from "obsidian";
import { Root, createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { ReactView } from "./ReactView";

const VIEW_TYPE_EXAMPLE = "example-view";

class ExampleView extends ItemView {
	root: Root | null = null;

	constructor(leaf: WorkspaceLeaf) {
		super(leaf);
	}

	getViewType() {
		return VIEW_TYPE_EXAMPLE;
	}

	getDisplayText() {
		return "Example view";
	}

	async onOpen() {
		this.root = createRoot(this.containerEl.children[1]);
		this.root.render(
			<StrictMode>
				<ReactView />,
			</StrictMode>
		);
	}

	async onClose() {
		this.root?.unmount();
	}
}
```

For more information on createRoot and unmount(), refer to the documentation on ReactDOM (https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/createRoot#root-render).

You can mount your React component on any HTMLElement, for example status bar items. Just make sure to clean up properly by calling this.root.unmount() when you're done.

# IMPORTANT: Additional React Instructions Specific to Components Needing App Access

## Create And Use an Obsidian App Context

If you want to access the App object from one of your React components, you need to create a React context for the app to make it globally available to all components inside your React view.

1. Use `createContext()` to create a new app context.

```tsx
import { createContext } from "react";
import { App } from "obsidian";

export const AppContext = createContext<App | undefined>(undefined);
```

2. Wrap the `ReactView` with a context provider and pass the app as the value.

```tsx
this.root = createRoot(this.containerEl.children[1]);
this.root.render(
	<AppContext.Provider value={this.app}>
		<ReactView />
	</AppContext.Provider>
);
```

3. Create a custom hook to make it easier to use the context in your components.

```tsx
import { useContext } from "react";
import { AppContext } from "./context";

export const useApp = (): App | undefined => {
	return useContext(AppContext);
};
```

4. Use the hook in any React component within `ReactView` to access the app.

```tsx
import { useApp } from "./hooks";

export const ReactView = () => {
	const { vault } = useApp();

	return <h4>{vault.getName()}</h4>;
};
```
