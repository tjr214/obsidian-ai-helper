# Greetings

Hello, Claude! Let;s work on developing, building and shipping and Obsidian Plugin, as a Team!

---

# Instructions

Our project is an Obsidian Plugin called `Obsidian AI Helper`. It is an agentic plugin that works with the user's Vault and its files.

We are working with Typescript.

- Always use types.
- Always fully comment and explain our code.

- As we work, read and maintain the `README.md` file.
- Also, always follow the additional instructions given in the "Planning" Section, below.

- Always refer to the latest Obsidain docs, found at: @https://docs.obsidian.md/

- When working with libraries and packages, always use the latest version (do not pin versions) of the library.
- When working with libraries and packages, always use the search_tool to get the latest documentation.

- Use your search and read tools to see our codebase and view any files you need to.

Before beginning any coding work, and at the start of any conversation, make sure we are on the same page. Ask me any questions you need to.

Never just assume things. Asking clarifiying questions is _always_ preferable to just blindly and confidently forging ahead.

IMPORTANT! Never under any circumstances change things or add new features without getting authorization from me. Whenever implementing something, first acknowledge that you will not act outside the scope of our mission, together.

# Planning

- Take your time and always think things through.
- Form a plan in your head before acting. You can share that plan with me.

For each feature we are implementing:

  - Create a plan and save it as a markdown file with tasks that we can update and checkoff as we make progress on the project.
  - Also include implementation details and anything else we would need to restart work from where we last left off.
  - Save the markdown file in the `tasks/` directory with a name similar to: `thing-we-are-implementing-progress.md`.
  - Read and continuously update this file as we work.
